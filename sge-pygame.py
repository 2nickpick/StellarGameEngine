"""Stellar Game Engine - Pygame 1.9

Stellar Game Engine is a library for Stellar.  It is a game engine
loosely based on Game Maker.

Except where otherwise noted, all documented features are required to be
offered by all implementations.  Any implementation failing to do so is
incomplete.

Constants:
    IMPLEMENTATION: A string identifying the how the engine is
        implemented (e.g. the name of the graphics library used).
    ALIGN_LEFT: Flag indicating alignment to the left.
    ALIGN_CENTER: Flag indicating alignment to the horizontal center.
    ALIGN_RIGHT: Flag indicating alignment to the right.
    ALIGN_TOP: Flag indicating alignment to the top.
    ALIGN_MIDDLE: Flag indicating alignment to the vertical middle.
    ALIGN_BOTTOM: Flag indicating alignment to the bottom.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT: The mouse button number which corresponds with
        the left mouse button.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT: The mouse button number which corresponds with
        the right mouse button.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE: The mouse button number which corresponds with
        the middle mouse button.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP: The mouse button number which corresponds
        with rolling the mouse wheel up.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN: The mouse button number which corresponds
        with rolling the mouse wheel down.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT: The mouse button number which corresponds
        with tilting the mouse wheel to the left.
    MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT: The mouse button number which corresponds
        with tilting the mouse wheel to the right.

Global variables:
    game: Stores the current game.  If there is no game currently, this
        variable is set to None.
    image_directories: A list of directories where images can be found.
        Default is ./data/images, ./data/sprites, or ./data/backgrounds.
    font_directories: A list of directories where font files can be
        found.  Default is ./data/fonts.
    sound_directories: A list of directories where sounds can be found.
        Default is ./data/sounds.
    music_directories: A list of directories where music files can be
        found.  Default is ./data/music.

Classes:
    Game: Class which handles the game.
    Sprite: Class used to store images and animations.
    BackgroundLayer: Class used to store a background layer.
    Background: Class used to store parallax-scrolling backgrounds.
    Font: Class used to store and handle fonts.
    Sound: Class used to store and play sound effects.
    Music: Class used to store and play music.
    StellarClass: Class used for game objects.
    Room: Class used for game rooms, e.g. levels.
    View: Class used for views in rooms.

Functions:
    create_object: Create an object in the current room.
    sound_stop_all: Stop playback of all sounds.

Implementation-specific information:
This implementation supports hardware rendering, which can improve
performance in some cases.  It is not enabled by default.  To enable it,
set ``sge.hardware_rendering`` to True.  To get the best performance
with hardware rendering, you should use colorkeys instead of alpha
transparency.

Since Pygame supports trackballs, they are implemented as extra analog
sticks.  Their movement is limited to the range of an analog stick to
ensure full compatibility.

In addition to Ogg Vorbis, Music supports the following formats:

    MP3 (support limited; use not recommended)
    MOD
    XM
    MIDI

For starting position in MOD files, the pattern order number is used
instead of the number of milliseconds.  For some other extra formats,
specifying the starting position may have no effect.

Game.draw_line supports anti-aliasing for lines with a thickness of 1
only.  No other drawing functions support anti-aliasing.

class Game(object):

    """Class which handles the game.

    A Game object must be created before anything else is done.

    All Game objects have the following attributes:
        width: The width of the game's display in pixels.
        height: The height of the game's display in pixels.
        fullscreen: True if the game should be in fullscreen, False
            otherwise.
        scale: A number indicating a fixed scale factor (e.g. 1 for no
            scaling, 2 for doubled size).  If set to 0, scaling is
            automatic (causes the game to fit the window or screen).
        scale_proportional: If set to True, scaling is always
            proportional.  If set to False, the image may be stretched
            to completely fill the game window or screen.  This has no
            effect unless ``scale`` is 0.
        scale_smooth: If set to True, a smooth scaling algorithm will be
            used, if available.  Otherwise, simple scaling (e.g. pixel
            doubling) will always be used.  Support for smooth scaling
            in Stellar Game Engine implementations is optional.  If the
            implementation used does not support smooth scaling, this
            option will always be treated as False.
        fps: The rate the game should run in frames per second.  Note
            that this is only the maximum; if the computer is not fast
            enough, the game may run more slowly.
        delta: If set to True, delta timing will be enabled, which
            adjusts speeds and animation rates if the game cannot run at
            the specified frame rate.
        delta_min: Delta timing can cause the game to be choppy.  This
            setting limits this by pretending that the frame rate is
            never lower than this amount, resulting in the game slowing
            down like normal if it is.

    The following read-only attributes are also available:
        sprites: A dictionary containing all loaded sprites, using their
            names as the keys.
        background_layers: A dictionary containing all loaded background
            layers, using their sprites' names as the keys.
        backgrounds: A dictionary containing all loaded backgrounds,
            using their unique identifiers as the keys.
        fonts: A dictionary containing all loaded fonts, using their
            names as the keys.
        sounds: A dictionary containing all loaded sounds, using their
            file names as the keys.
        music: A dictionary containing all loaded music, using their
            file names as the keys.
        objects: A dictionary containing all StellarClass objects in the
            game, using their unique identifiers as the keys.
        rooms: A list containing all rooms in order of their creation.
        current_room: The Room object which is currently active.
        mouse: A StellarClass object which represents the mouse cursor.
            Its ID is "mouse" and its bounding box is one pixel.
            Speed variables are determined by averaging all mouse
            movement during the last quarter of a second.  Assigning to
            its ``visible`` attribute controls whether or not the mouse
            cursor is shown.  Setting its sprite sets the mouse cursor.

    Game methods:
        start: Start the game at the first room.
        end: Properly end the game.
        pause: Pause the game.
        unpause: Unpause the game.
        get_key_pressed: Return whether or not a given key is pressed.
        get_mouse_button_pressed: Return whether or not a given mouse
            button is pressed.
        get_joystick_axis: Return the position of the given axis.
        get_joystick_hat: Return the position of the given HAT.
        get_joystick_button_pressed: Return whether or not the given
            joystick button is pressed.
        get_joysticks: Return the number of joysticks available.
        get_joystick_axes: Return the number of axes on the given
            joystick.
        get_joystick_hats: Return the number of HATs on the given
            joystick.
        get_joystick_buttons: Return the number of buttons on the
            given joystick.

    Game events are handled by special methods.  The exact timing of
    their calling is implementation-dependent except where otherwise
    noted.  The methods are:
        event_game_start: Called when the game starts.  This is only
            called once (it is not called again when the game restarts)
            and it is always the first event method called.
        event_step: Called once each frame.
        event_key_press: Key press event.
        event_key_release: Key release event.
        event_mouse_move: Mouse move event.
        event_mouse_button_press: Mouse button press event.
        event_mouse_button_release: Mouse button release event.
        event_joystick_axis_move: Joystick axis move event.
        event_joystick_hat_move: Joystick HAT move event.
        event_joystick_button_press: Joystick button press event.
        event_joystick_button_release: Joystick button release event.
        event_close: Close event (e.g. close button).  It is always
            called after any room close events occurring at the same
            time.
        event_mouse_collision: Middle/default mouse collision event.
        event_mouse_collision_left: Left mouse collision event.
        event_mouse_collision_right: Right mouse collision event.
        event_mouse_collision_top: Top mouse collision event.
        event_mouse_collision_bottom: Bottom mouse collision event.
        event_game_end: Called when the game ends.  This is only called
            once and it is always the last event method called.

    The following alternative events are executed when the game is
    paused in place of the corresponding normal events:
        event_paused_key_press
        event_paused_key_release
        event_paused_mouse_move
        event_paused_mouse_button_press
        event_paused_mouse_button_release
        event_paused_joystick_axis_move
        event_paused_joystick_hat_move
        event_paused_joystick_button_press
        event_paused_joystick_button_release
        event_paused_close

        width: The width of the sprite in pixels.
        height: The height of the sprite in pixels.
        origin_x: The horizontal location of the origin (the pixel
            position in relation to the images to base rendering on),
            where the left edge of the image is 0 and origin_x increases
            toward the right.

            position in relation to the images to base rendering on),
            where the top edge of the image is 0 and origin_y increases
            toward the bottom.
        transparent: True if the image should support transparency,
            False otherwise.  If the image does not have an alpha
            channel or if the implementation used does not support alpha
            transparency, a colorkey will be used, with the transparent
            color being the color of the top-rightmost pixel.
        fps: The suggested rate in frames per second to animate the
            image at.
        bbox_x: The horizontal location of the top-left corner of the

            origin_x is 0 and bbox_x increases toward the right.
        bbox_y: The vertical location of the top-left corner of the

        name: The name of the sprite given when it was created.  See
            Sprite.__init__.__doc__ for more information.

    Sprite methods:
        draw_dot: Draw a single-pixel dot.
        draw_line: Draw a line segment between the given points.
        draw_rectangle: Draw a rectangle at the given position.
        draw_ellipse: Draw an ellipse at the given position.
        draw_circle: Draw a circle at the given position.

        ``name`` indicates the base name of the image files.  Files are
        to be located in one of the directories specified in
        ``image_directories``.  If a file with the exact name plus image
        file extensions is not available, numbered images will be
        searched for which have names with one of the following formats,
        where "name" is replaced with the specified base file name and
        "0" can be replaced with any integer:

            name-0
            name_0

        If images are found with names like those, all such images will
        be loaded and become frames of animation.  If not, sprite sheets
        will be searched for which have names with one of the following
        formats, where "name" is replaced with the specified base file
        name and "2" can be replaced with any integer:

            name-strip2
            name_strip2

        The number indicates the number of animation frames in the
        sprite sheet. The sprite sheet will be read like a horizontal
        reel, with the first frame on the far left and the last frame on
        the far right, and no space in between frames.

        ``name`` can also be None, in which case the sprite will be a
        transparent rectangle at the specified size (with both ``width``
        and ``height`` defaulting to 32 if they are set to None).  The
        implementation decides what to assign to the sprite's ``name``
        attribute, but it is always a string.

        If no image is found based on any of the above methods and
        ``name`` is not None, IOError will be raised.

        If ``width`` or ``height`` is set to None, the respective size
        will be taken from the largest animation frame.  If
        ``bbox_width`` or ``bbox_height`` is set to None, the respective
        size will be the respective size of the sprite.

        All remaining arguments set the initial properties of the
        sprite; see Sprite.__doc__ for more information.

    Music is mostly the same as sound, but only one can be played at a
    time.

    All Music objects have the following attributes:
        volume: The volume of the music in percent (0 for no sound, 100
            for max sound).
        balance: The balance of the music on stereo speakers.  A value
            of 0 means centered (an equal amount of play on both
            speakers), -1 means entirely in the left speaker, and 1
            means entirely in the right speaker.  Support for this
            feature in Stellar Game Engine implementations is optional.
            If it is unavailable, all music will be played through both
            speakers equally (assuming stereo sound is used).

    The following read-only attributes are also available:
        fname: The file name of the music given when it was created.
            See Music.__init__.__doc__ for more information.
        length: The length of the music in milliseconds.
        playing: Whether or not the music is playing.
        position: The current position (time) on the music in
            milliseconds.

    Music methods:
        Music.play: Play the music.
        Music.queue: Queue the music for playback.
        Music.stop: Stop the music.
        Music.pause: Pause playback of the music.
        Music.unpause: Resume playback of the music if paused.
        Music.restart: Restart music from the beginning.

    Ogg Vorbis is supported at a minimum.  Depending on the
    implementation, other formats may be supported.

        y: The vertical position of the object in the room, where the
            top edge is 0 and y increases toward the bottom.
        z: The Z-axis position of the object in the room, which
            determines in what order objects are drawn; objects with a
            higher Z value are drawn in front of objects with a lower Z
            value.
        sprite: The sprite currently in use by this object.  Set to None
            for no (visible) sprite.  While it will always be an actual
            Sprite object or None when read, it can also be set to the
            ID of a sprite.
        visible: Whether or not the object should be drawn.
        detects_collisions: Whether or not the object should be involved
            in collisions.
        bbox_x: The horizontal location of the top-left corner of the

        collision_precise: Whether or not precise (pixel-perfect)
            collision detection should be used.
        bbox_left: The position of the left side of the bounding box in
            the room (same as x + bbox_x).
        bbox_right: The position of the right side of the bounding box
            in the room (same as bbox_left + bbox_width).
        bbox_top: The position of the top side of the bounding box

            a positive direction being counter-clockwise.  Default is 0.
        image_index: The animation frame currently being displayed, with
            0 being the first one.  Default is 0.
        image_fps: The animation rate in frames per second.  Default is
            the value recommended by the sprite, or 0 if there is no
            sprite.
        image_xscale: The horizontal scale factor for the sprite.
            Default is 1.
        image_yscale: The vertical scale factor for the sprite.  Default
            is 1.

            positive direction being counter-clockwise.  Default is 0.
        image_alpha: The alpha value applied to the entire image, where
            255 is the original image, 128 is half the opacity of the
            original image, 0 is fully transparent, etc.  Default is
            255.
        image_blend: The color to blend with the sprite.  Set to None
            for no color blending.  Default is None.

    The following read-only attributes are also available:
        id: The unique identifier for this object.

        ystart: The initial value of y when the object was created.
        xprevious: The previous value of x.
        yprevious: The previous value of y.

    StellarClass methods:
        collides: Return whether or not this object collides with
            another.
        set_alarm: Set an alarm.
        destroy: Destroy the object.

    StellarClass events are handled by special methods.  The exact
    timing of their calling is implementation-dependent except where
    otherwise noted.  The methods are:
        event_create: Called when the object is created.  It is always
            called after any room start events occurring at the same
            time.
        event_step: Called once each frame.
        event_alarm: Called when an alarm counter reaches 0.
        event_key_press: Key press event.
        event_key_release: Key release event.
        event_mouse_move: Mouse move event.
        event_mouse_button_press: Mouse button press event.
        event_mouse_button_release: Mouse button release event.
        event_joystick_axis_move: Joystick axis move event.
        event_joystick_hat_move: Joystick HAT move event.
        event_joystick_button_press: Joystick button press event.
        event_joystick_button_release: Joystick button release event.
        event_close: Close event (e.g. close button).
        event_collision: Middle/default collision event.
        event_collision_left: Left collision event.
        event_collision_right: Right collision event.
        event_collision_top: Top collision event.
        event_collision_bottom: Bottom collision event.
        event_animation_end: Called when an animation cycle ends.
        event_destroy: Destroy event.

    The following alternative events are executed when the game is
    paused in place of the corresponding normal events:
        event_paused_key_press
        event_paused_key_release
        event_paused_mouse_move
        event_paused_mouse_button_press

    """Class for rooms.

    All Room objects have the following attributes:
        width: The width of the room in pixels.
        height: The height of the room in pixels.
        views: A list containing all View objects in the room.
        background: The Background object used.  While it will always be
            the actual object when read, it can be set to either an
            actual background object or the ID of a background.

    The following read-only attributes are also available:
        objects: A tuple containing all StellarClass objects in the
            room.
        room_number: The index of this room in the game, where 0 is the
            first room, or None if this room has not been added to a
            game.

    Room methods:
        add: Add a StellarClass object to the room.
        start: Start the room.
        resume: Continue the room from where it left off.
        end: Go to the next room.

    Room events are handled by special methods.  The exact timing of
    their calling is implementation-dependent except where otherwise
    noted.  The methods are:
        event_room_start: Called when the room starts.  It is always
            called after any game start events and before any object
            create events occurring at the same time.
        event_step: Called once each frame.
        event_key_press: Key press event.
        event_key_release: Key release event.
        event_mouse_move: Mouse move event.
        event_mouse_button_press: Mouse button press event.
        event_mouse_button_release: Mouse button release event.
        event_joystick_axis_move: Joystick axis move event.
        event_joystick_hat_move: Joystick HAT move event.
        event_joystick_button_press: Joystick button press event.
        event_joystick_button_release: Joystick button release event.
        event_close: Close event (e.g. close button).  It is always
            called before any game close events occurring at the same
            time.
        event_room_end: Called when the room ends.  It is always called
            before any game end events occurring at the same time.

    The following alternative events are executed when the game is
    paused in place of the corresponding normal events:
        event_paused_key_press
        event_paused_key_release
        event_paused_mouse_move
        event_paused_mouse_button_press
