    """Sound handling class.

    All Sound objects have the following attributes:
        volume: The volume of the sound in percent (0 for no sound, 100
            for max sound).
        balance: The balance of the sound effect on stereo speakers.  A
            value of 0 means centered (an equal amount of play on both
            speakers), -1 means entirely in the left speaker, and 1
            means entirely in the right speaker.  Support for this
            feature in Stellar Game Engine implementations is optional.
            If it is unavailable, all sounds will be played through both
            speakers equally (assuming stereo sound is used).
        max_play: The maximum instances of this sound playing permitted.
            Set to 0 for no limit.

    The following read-only attributes are also available:
        fname: The file name of the sound given when it was created.
            See Sound.__init__.__doc__ for more information.
        length: The length of the sound in milliseconds.
        playing: The number of instances of this sound playing.

    Sound methods:
        Sound.play: Play the sound.
        Sound.stop: Stop the sound.
        Sound.pause: Pause playback of the sound.
        Sound.unpause: Resume playback of the sound if paused.
