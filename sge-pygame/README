Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.6 or later, but not Python 3 <http://www.python.org>
- Pygame 1.9 or later <http://pygame.org>

Formats Support
---------------

`Sprite` supports the following image formats:
- PNG
- JPEG
- Non-animated GIF
- BMP
- PCX
- Uncompressed Truevision TGA
- TIFF
- ILBM
- Netpbm
- X Pixmap

`Sound` supports the following audio formats:
- Uncompressed WAV
- Ogg Vorbis

`Music` supports the following audio formats:
- Ogg Vorbis
- MP3 (support limited; use not recommended)
- MOD
- XM
- MIDI

For starting position in MOD files, the pattern order number is used
instead of the number of milliseconds.

If Pygame is built without full image support, `Sprite` will only
support uncompressed BMP images.  In addition, the pygame.mixer module,
which is used for audio playback, is optional and depends on SDL_mixer;
if pygame.mixer is unavailable, sounds and music will not play.  If you
encounter problems with loading images or playing sounds, check your
build of Pygame.

On some systems, the game will crash if `Music` attempts to load an
unsupported format.  Since MP3's support is limited, it is best to avoid
using it; consider using Ogg instead.

Missing Optional Features
-------------------------

`Sprite.draw_line` and `Room.project_line` support anti-aliasing for
lines with a thickness of 1 only.  `Sprite.draw_text` and
`Room.project_text` support anti-aliasing in all cases.  No other
drawing or projecting methods support anti-aliasing.

Speed Improvements
------------------

This implementation supports hardware rendering, which can improve
performance in some cases.  It is not enabled by default.  To enable it,
set ``sge.hardware_rendering`` to True.  The benefit of hardware
acceleration is usually negligible, which is why it is disabled by
default.

Projection is highly inefficient, so it should be avoided if speed is
important; use the sprite draw methods instead.
