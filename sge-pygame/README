Implementation-Specific Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This implementation supports hardware rendering, which can improve
performance in some cases.  It is not enabled by default.  To enable it,
set ``sge.hardware_rendering`` to True.  To get the best performance
with hardware rendering, you should use colorkeys instead of alpha
transparency.

Since Pygame supports trackballs, they are implemented as extra analog
sticks.  Their movement is limited to the range of an analog stick to
ensure full compatibility.  You can disable this limitation by setting
``sge.real_trackballs`` to True.

In addition to Ogg Vorbis, sge.Music supports the following formats:

    MP3 (support limited; use not recommended)
    MOD
    XM
    MIDI

For starting position in MOD files, the pattern order number is used
instead of the number of milliseconds.  For some other extra formats,
specifying the starting position may have no effect.

sge.Sprite.draw_line supports anti-aliasing for lines with a thickness
of 1 only.  sge.Sprite.draw_text supports anti-aliasing in all cases.
No other drawing functions support anti-aliasing.
