    """Class for room views.

    All View objects have the following attributes:
        x: The horizontal position of the view in the room, where the
            left edge is 0 and x increases toward the right.  When set,
            if it brings the view outside the room it is in, it will be
            re-adjusted so that the view is completely inside the room.
        y: The vertical position of the view in the room, where the top
            edge is 0 and y increases toward the bottom.  When set, if
            it brings the view outside the room it is in, it will be
            re-adjusted so that the view is completely inside the room.
        xport: The horizontal position of the view on the screen, where
            the left edge is 0 and xport increases toward the right.
        yport: The vertical position of the view on the screen, where
            the top edge is 0 and yport increases toward the bottom.
        width: The width of the view in pixels.  When set, if it results
            in the view being outside the room it is in, ``x`` will be
            adjusted so that the view is completely inside the room.
        height: The height of the view in pixels.  When set, if it
            results in the view being outside the room it is in, ``y``
            will be adjusted so that the view is completely inside the
            room.
