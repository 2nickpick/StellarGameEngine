class Room(object):

    """Class for rooms.

    All Room objects have the following attributes:
        width: The width of the room in pixels.
        height: The height of the room in pixels.
        views: A list containing all View objects in the room.
        background: The Background object used.  While it will always be
            the actual object when read, it can be set to either an
            actual background object or the ID of a background.

    The following read-only attributes are also available:
        objects: A tuple containing all StellarClass objects in the
            room.
        room_number: The index of this room in the game, where 0 is the
            first room, or None if this room has not been added to a
            game.

    Room methods:
        add: Add a StellarClass object to the room.
        start: Start the room.
        resume: Continue the room from where it left off.
        end: Go to the next room.

    Room events are handled by special methods.  The exact timing of
    their calling is implementation-dependent except where otherwise
    noted.  The methods are:
        event_room_start: Called when the room starts.  It is always
            called after any game start events and before any object
            create events occurring at the same time.
        event_step: Called once each frame.
        event_key_press: Key press event.
        event_key_release: Key release event.
        event_mouse_move: Mouse move event.
        event_mouse_button_press: Mouse button press event.
        event_mouse_button_release: Mouse button release event.
        event_joystick_axis_move: Joystick axis move event.
        event_joystick_hat_move: Joystick HAT move event.
        event_joystick_button_press: Joystick button press event.
        event_joystick_button_release: Joystick button release event.
        event_close: Close event (e.g. close button).  It is always
            called before any game close events occurring at the same
            time.
        event_room_end: Called when the room ends.  It is always called
            before any game end events occurring at the same time.

    The following alternative events are executed when the game is
    paused in place of the corresponding normal events:
        event_paused_key_press
        event_paused_key_release
        event_paused_mouse_move
        event_paused_mouse_button_press
        event_paused_mouse_button_release
        event_paused_joystick_axis_move
        event_paused_joystick_hat_move

        event_paused_joystick_button_release
        event_paused_close
