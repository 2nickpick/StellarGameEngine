I. Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stellar Game Engine (or "SGE") is a game engine designed for use by
Stellar.  Its design is loosely based on the proprietary program, Game
Maker.  The purpose of SGE is to make game development easier, which
allows more rapid development by experienced game developers and also
helps less experienced game developers learn how to develop games.


II. SGE Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  II.A. Events
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Much like Game Maker, SGE uses an event-based system, with events
  defined by special class methods with names that start with "event_".

  Except in certain special cases, events are handled in an arbitrary
  order; if Event A and Event B happen at the same time, one
  implementation might handle Event A first, while another
  implementation might handle Event B first.  Still another
  implementation might in theory even handle Event A first one frame,
  then handle Event B in another.
  
  
  II.B. The Mouse
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  The mouse is handled somewhat unusually in SGE.  Rather than having
  functions or variables report the mouse position relative to the
  screen, the mouse position within the room, calculated based on its
  position on the screen by SGE, is recorded in a special
  sge.StellarClass object which represents the mouse.  This mouse object
  can be found as sge.game.mouse, and it has the special object ID,
  "mouse".
  
  The mouse object differs from most sge.StellarClass objects in a few
  ways.  Since its position is controlled by SGE, its position cannot
  be manually set.  Its speed variables also cannot be manually set, and
  they always report numbers which correspond to the average motion of
  the mouse during the last quarter of a second.  Setting
  sge.game.mouse.visible toggles whether or not the mouse cursor itself
  is visible, and setting sge.game.mouse.sprite sets the mouse cursor to
  the sprite assigned.  When detecting collisions, the mouse object is
  always treated as having only a one-pixel bounding box at the position
  of the mouse, ignoring the regular bounding box attributes.
  
  In all other ways, the mouse object is exactly the same as all other
  sge.StellarClass objects.

III. Global Variables and Constants
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constants:
* IMPLEMENTATION: A string identifying the how the engine is implemented
    (e.g. the name of the graphics library used).
* ALIGN_LEFT: Flag indicating alignment to the left.
* ALIGN_CENTER: Flag indicating alignment to the horizontal center.
* ALIGN_RIGHT: Flag indicating alignment to the right.
* ALIGN_TOP: Flag indicating alignment to the top.
* ALIGN_MIDDLE: Flag indicating alignment to the vertical middle.
* ALIGN_BOTTOM: Flag indicating alignment to the bottom.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT: The mouse button number which corresponds with the
    left mouse button.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT: The mouse button number which corresponds with the
    right mouse button.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE: The mouse button number which corresponds with
    the middle mouse button.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP: The mouse button number which corresponds with
    rolling the mouse wheel up.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN: The mouse button number which corresponds
    with rolling the mouse wheel down.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT: The mouse button number which corresponds
    with tilting the mouse wheel to the left.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT: The mouse button number which corresponds
    with tilting the mouse wheel to the right.

Global variables:
* game: Stores the current game.  If there is no game currently, this
    variable is set to None.
* image_directories: A list of directories where images can be found.
    Default is ./data/images, ./data/sprites, or ./data/backgrounds.
* font_directories: A list of directories where font files can be found.
    Default is ./data/fonts.
* sound_directories: A list of directories where sounds can be found.
    Default is ./data/sounds.
* music_directories: A list of directories where music files can be
    found.  Default is ./data/music.


IV. Classes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes are the heart of SGE's operation.  Most functionality in games
is best implemented via subclassing SGE's classes.


  IV.A. sge.Game
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  This class handles most parts of the game which operate on a global
  scale, such as global game events.  Before anything else is done with
  SGE, an object either of this class or of a class derived from this
  class must be created.
  
  When an object of this class is created, it is automatically assigned
  to sge.game.
  
  Note: Do not create multiple sge.Game objects.  Doing so may cause
  errors.
  
  Attributes:
  * width: The width of the game's display in pixels.
  * height: The height of the game's display in pixels.
  * fullscreen: True if the game should be in fullscreen, False
      otherwise.
  * scale: A number indicating a fixed scale factor (e.g. 1 for no
      scaling, 2 for doubled size).  If set to 0, scaling is automatic
      (causes the game to fit the window or screen).
  * scale_proportional: If set to True, scaling is always
      proportional.  If set to False, the image may be stretched to
      completely fill the game window or screen.  This has no effect
      unless ``scale`` is 0.
  * scale_smooth: If set to True, a smooth scaling algorithm will be
      used, if available.  Otherwise, simple scaling (e.g. pixel
      doubling) will always be used.  Support for smooth scaling in
      Stellar Game Engine implementations is optional.  If the
      implementation used does not support smooth scaling, this option
      will always be treated as False.
  * fps: The rate the game should run in frames per second.  Note that
      this is only the maximum; if the computer is not fast enough, the
      game may run more slowly.
  * delta: If set to True, delta timing will be enabled, which adjusts
      speeds and animation rates if the game cannot run at the specified
      frame rate.
  * delta_min: Delta timing can cause the game to be choppy.  This
      setting limits this by pretending that the frame rate is never
      lower than this amount, resulting in the game slowing down like
      normal if it is.
  
  Read-Only Attributes:
  * sprites: A dictionary containing all loaded sprites, using their
      names as the keys.
  * background_layers: A dictionary containing all loaded background
      layers, using their sprites' names as the keys.
  * backgrounds: A dictionary containing all loaded backgrounds, using
      their unique identifiers as the keys.
  * fonts: A dictionary containing all loaded fonts, using their names
      as the keys.
  * sounds: A dictionary containing all loaded sounds, using their file
      names as the keys.
  * music: A dictionary containing all loaded music, using their file
      names as the keys.
  * objects: A dictionary containing all sge.StellarClass objects in the
      game, using their unique identifiers as the keys.
  * rooms: A list containing all rooms in order of their creation.
  * current_room: The Room object which is currently active.
  * mouse: An sge.StellarClass object which represents the mouse cursor.
      Its ID is "mouse" and its bounding box is one pixel.  Speed
      variables are determined by averaging all mouse movement during
      the last quarter of a second.  Assigning to its ``visible``
      attribute controls whether or not the mouse cursor is shown.
      Setting its sprite sets the mouse cursor.
  
  
    IV.A.1. Constructor Method (sge.Game.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.__init__(self, width=640, height=480, fullscreen=False,
        scale=0, scale_proportional=True, scale_smooth=False, fps=60,
        delta=False, delta_min=15)
    
    All arguments are used to set the respective initial attributes of
    the object.
    
    
    IV.A.2. sge.Game.start
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.start(self)
    
    Starts the game in the first room.  This method can also be called
    at any time during the game to restart the game, resetting
    everything to its original state.
    
    
    IV.A.3. sge.Game.end
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.end(self)
    
    Ends the game.  Please use this rather than sys.exit, as some
    implementations might do some clean-up here.
    
    
    IV.A.4. sge.Game.pause
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.pause(self, sprite=None)
    
    Pauses the game, showing ``sprite`` (an sge.Sprite object) in the
    center of the screen.  If ``sprite`` is None, a default image is
    used instead; the exact image used is implementation-dependent.
    
    Normal events are not executed while the game is paused.  Instead,
    events with the same name, but prefixed with "event_paused_" instead
    of "event_", are executed.  Note that not all events have these
    alternative "paused" events associated with them.
    
    
    IV.A.5. sge.Game.unpause
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.unpause(self)
    
    Unpauses the game.
    
    
    IV.A.6. sge.Game.event_game_start
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_game_start(self)
    
    Game Start event.  This event is executed when the game starts.  It
    is only executed once (it is not executed again when the game
    restarts) and it is always the very first event executed.
    
    
    IV.A.7. sge.Game.event_step
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_step(self, time_passed)
    
    Step event.  This event is always executed once each frame.
    ``time_passed`` indicates the number of milliseconds that have
    passed during the last frame.
    
    
    IV.A.8. sge.Game.event_key_press
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_key_press(self, key)
    
    Key Press event.  This event is executed when a key on the keyboard
    is pressed.  ``key`` indicates the identifier string of the key that
    was pressed (see KEYS.txt for a list of all key identifier strings).
    
    
    IV.A.9. sge.Game.event_key_release
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_key_release(self, key)
    
    Key Release event.  This event is executed when a key on the
    keyboard is released.  ``key`` indicates the identifier string of
    the key that was released (see KEYS.txt for a list of all key
    identifier strings).
    
    
    IV.A.10. sge.Game.event_mouse_move
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_mouse_move(self, x, y)
    
    Mouse Move event.  This event is executed when the mouse moves.
    ``x`` indicates the horizontal relative movement of the mouse, and
    ``y`` indicates the vertical relative movement of the mouse.
    
    
    IV.A.11. sge.Game.event_mouse_button_press
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_mouse_button_press(self, button)
    
    Mouse Button Press event.  This event is executed when a mouse
    button is pressed.  ``button`` indicates the number of the button
    that was pressed.  What button numbers correspond to what buttons
    can vary among implementations, so ``button`` should be checked
    against the following constants:
    
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT
    
    
    IV.A.12. sge.Game.event_mouse_button_release
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event.mouse_button_release(self, button)
    
    Mouse Button Release event.  This event is executed when a mouse
    button is released.  ``button`` indicates the number of the button
    that was released.  What button numbers correspond to what buttons
    can vary among implementations, so ``button`` should be checked
    against the following constants:
    
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT
    
    
    IV.A.13. sge.Game.event_joystick_axis_move
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_joystick_axis_move(self, joystick, axis, value)
    
    Joystick Axis Move event.  This event is executed when an axis on a
    joystick changes position.  ``joystick`` indicates the number of the
    joystick, where 0 is the first joystick.  ``axis`` indicates the
    number of the axis, where 0 is the first axis.  ``value`` indicates
    the tilt of the axis, where 0 is in the center, -1 is tilted all the
    way to the left or up, and 1 is tilted all the way to the right or
    down.  Note that ``value`` can be any floating-point number between
    -1 and 1; it is not limited to integral values.
    
    Support for joysticks in SGE implementations is optional.


    IV.A.14. sge.Game.event_joystick_hat_move
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_joystick_hat_move(self, joystick, hat, x, y)
    
    Joystick HAT Move event.  This event is executed when a HAT switch
    (also called the POV hat, POV switch, or d-pad) changes position.
    ``joystick`` indicates the number of the joystick, where 0 is the
    first joystick.  ``hat`` indicates the number of the HAT, where 0 is
    the first HAT.  ``x`` indicates the horizontal position of the HAT,
    where 0 is in the center, -1 is left, and 1 is right.  ``y``
    indicates the vertical position of the HAT, where 0 is in the
    center, -1 is up, and 1 is down.
    
    Support for joysticks in SGE implementations is optional.
    
    
    IV.A.15. sge.Game.event_joystick_button_press
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_joystick_button_press(self, joystick, button)
    
    Joystick Button Press event.  This event is executed when a joystick
    button is pressed.  ``joystick`` indicates the number of the
    joystick, where 0 is the first joystick.  ``button`` indicates the
    number of the button that was pressed, where 0 is the first button
    on the joystick.
    
    Support for joysticks in SGE implementations is optional.
    
    
    IV.A.16. sge.Game.event_joystick_button_release
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_joystick_button_release(self, joystick, button)
    
    Joystick Button Release event.  This event is executed when a
    joystick button is released.  ``joystick`` indicates the number of
    the joystick, where 0 is the first joystick.  ``button`` indicates
    the number of the button that was released, where 0 is the first
    button on the joystick.
    
    Support for joysticks in SGE implementations is optional.


    IV.A.17. sge.Game.event_close
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_close(self)
    
    Close event.  This event is executed when the operating system tells
    the game to close, e.g. when the user presses the close button in
    the window frame.  It is always called after any
    sge.Room.event_close occurring at the same time.
    
    
    IV.A.18. sge.Game.event_mouse_collision
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    sge.Game.event_mouse_collision(self, other)
    
    Default Mouse Collision event.  This event is executed when
    sge.game.mouse collides with another object and none of the
    directional collision events are appropriate.  In particular, this
    event is executed if the collision was already happening in the
    previous frame, meaning that the object is colliding with the inside
    of the mouse. In addition, directional mouse collision events cause
    this event to execute by default if they are not overridden.
    
    
    IV.A.19. sge.Game.event_mouse_collision_left
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
